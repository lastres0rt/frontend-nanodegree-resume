## Resources Used

* [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com) provided most of the framework for making the website responsive and providing the columns for the JSON content.

The [CSS documentation,](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) in particular, helped with things that would've been far more difficult otherwise like placing my profile image in a circle.
* [CSS Border Properties](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-style.asp) for the dashed borders, which provides an... interesting effect I've tried to make use of below.
